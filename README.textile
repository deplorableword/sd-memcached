h1. Adds Memcached Monitoring to Server Density

Installation

* Configure your agent so that it knows about plugins http://www.serverdensity.com/docs/agent/plugins/ 
* Move the Memcached.py into that directory 
* By default, we check on 127.0.0.1:11211 for Memcached, if it runs on another port edit lines 15 & 16
* Restart the agent (service sd-agent restart)
* Enjoy Memcached stats in Server Density
